  </div>

   <!-- is an award-winning Vancouver-based start up that was co-founded by SFU's Ryan Stols. Their browser-based product is the only golf statistics tracking software to incorporate the usage of mental statistics. These statistics are then used by golfers of all skill levels to track progress and compare themselves with others. -->

      <h3> <b> Why was a design intervention needed? </b> </h3>
      <p>
        Ryan came to the Hackathon with a clear goal of having a <b> mobile app </b> designed due a number of reasons, as uncovered through our client interview:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li> <h4> The current software is desktop-only </h4> </li>
        <li> <h4> Novice users are overwhelmed with the complexity and amount of statistics involved </h4> </li>
        <li> <h4> Novice users are unsure of how to navigate the software </h4> </li>
        <li> <h4> There is a lack of integration between the mental and quantitative golf statistics </h4> </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="block-details">
      <h3> <b> The existing software </b> </h3>

    <h3 class="divider left-aligned"> framing the problem area </h3>
  </div>

  <div class="block-details">
    <h3> <b> Problems and insights  </b> </h3>
    <p>
      Givin the timeline, we decided to split the seven days into three sections: 2 days of research, 2 days of solution-finding, and 3 days of prototyping + preparing the final presentation.
    </p>
    <img class="header-image" src="compressed-images/new/brainstorming.png" alt="problems and insights brainstorming">

    <p>
      We began the research process by breaking down the problems to determine the problems + priorities and stakeholders. We employed Bullseye Diagramming to rank the problems we organized through Affinity Clustering, and resulted in the following high-priority problems to address:
    </p>

    <ol class="highlight">
      <li> <h4> Integration of mental + physical statistics  </h4> </li>
      <li> <h4> Complexity with inputting data </h4> </li>
      <li> <h4> Giving athletes tools for healthy habits </h4></li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      We then framed the problem area as the following with these insights in mind:

  <div class="divide">
    <h3 class="divider left-aligned"> solutions </h3>
  </div>

  <div class="block-details">
    <p>
      With these problem areas established, my team and I then conducted further research to better understand the domain and gather supporting information.
    </p>

    <img class="header-image" src="compressed-images/new/research.png" alt="problems and insights brainstorming">

    <br>
    <br>

    <p>
      Once completed, we consolidated our findings and created various solution-based brainstorming. We each tried to come up with bizzare or almost fictitious designs that pushed ourselves to display the sum of all of our work.
    </p>

      <img class="header-image" src="compressed-images/new/solutions.png" alt="problems and insights brainstorming">


      <p>
        We proceeded to compare and determine which of the solutions to move on with by using an <b> Importance/Difficulty Matrix </b>, and eventually settled on the mobile app. Although we weren't surprised that we settled on such a direction, we were able to incorporate insights we gained from ideating a variety of different solutions.

      <li> <h4> how to provide customized insights depending on users' data input </h4></li>

  </div>

  <div>
    This hackathon was a perfect opportunity for me to cap off my University career. Although I was excited to be a part of it, I was honestly largely nervous and anxious; this was amplified throughout the project as it was a very different experience being thrust into a project and being let loose versus being walked through a course project week by week (even though in class it felt like we were being fully autonomous).
  </div>

  <br>

  <div>
    As a whole, I am extremely proud of the work my team and I was able to produce. This is especially because our interface was chosen by one judge by the best in the client group, and also was selected by our client to be used as reference for their official mobile app.
