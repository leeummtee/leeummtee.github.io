      <h3> objective </h3>
      <p>
        Project for an Introduction to Technological Systems class. Students were given a three-week timeframe to create an interactive system which consisted of a digital environment with physical circuit controls.
      </p>

      <h3> programs used </h3>
      <p>
        Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Arduino, Processing.

      <h3> a. inspiration </h3>
      <p>
        Our main inspiration was a pc "game" called Kind Words. It consists of players writing  and receiving positive letters to others in a cozy virtual room, all while listening to some relaxing lo-fi music (shown below). We were really inspired by the way that the developers were able to create such a soothing environment through the use of visuals and music, so we wanted to create our own take on the idea.

      <h3> b. our idea </h3>
      <p>
        We wanted to create a relaxing interactive environment that changed depending the time  selected on a physical clock. The changing elements include the clutter in the room, the background music, and the background itself. To begin, we made basic vectors in Adobe Illustrator to test in Processing with our preliminary code.

      <h3> c. my role </h3>
      <p>
        My role was to create the base room and some of the items within it. This included the blinds, stone wall, toys, trophy, bed, paper crumples, and the cup noodles. I also created the schematic diagram and the physical clock with a solderless breadboard, electronic components, and cardboard.

      <p>
        Working on this project made me realize how important it is for a poster to able to get a lot of information across with just a quick glance. My first design had too much content and would require a passerby to thoroughly read through all of
        it to get the full meaning behind the poster. However, I feel that the changes I made allowed for a much clearer message to be communicated in a much quicker way.
